How to use what's in there:

1. download the gh-pages branch of the repo from this link https://github.com/chorasimilarity/chemlambda-gui/archive/gh-pages.zip
2. open a terminal window, change directory to the folder "dynamic"
3. type, for example "bash quiner_shuffle.sh". There are several pairs of scripts, like quiner_shuffle.sh and quiner_shuffle.awk. The parameters (number of cycles, weights of moves, visualisation parameters, see comments in the .awk script) are set by editing the awk script. 
4. you shall see the list of all .mol files from the "Äúdynamic"Äù folder. Each mol file represents a chemlambda molecule. If you want to reproduce a demo, then choose the file.mol which corresponds to the file.html name of the demo page http://chorasimilarity.github.io/chemlambda-gui/dynamic/demos.html 


There is an older gallery of examples, explanations and downloads of the first version of these scripts, at the page http://imar.ro/~mbuliga/gallery.html
