(I.e. it works every time.) Recall that I took a lambda term for the factorial from  the <a href="http://www.little-lisper.org/website/files/lambda-calculus-tutorial.pdf">lambda calculus tutorial by Mayer Goldberg from the little-lisper.org</a>, par. 57, page 14. Then I modified it and got a molecule which computes the factorial in about 20% of the cases. Now, in this working factorial example, I made two supplementary modifications. The first consists in starting from a lambda term which uses the mutiplication in the form L mnf.m(nf) instead of the one used in the tutorial. Secondly, the result of the computation (i.e. the "value" of the factorial) is applied to a SUCC (successor) which is then applied to c0, which result in the generation of the correct result.</ul>

    margin:35px 0 36px;      > <a href="http://chorasimilarity.github.io/chemlambda-gui/dynamic/lisfact_4.html">The factorial and the little lisper.</a> There are several demos which explore the computation of the factorial, with surprising lessons to learn. The <a href="http://chorasimilarity.github.io/chemlambda-gui/dynamic/times_only.html">first one</a> is a computation of a function with two inputs and two outputs, then there is <a href="http://chorasimilarity.github.io/chemlambda-gui/dynamic/factorial_of_3.html">an example of a successful computation of the factorial of 3</a>, based on a molecule which is a modification  of the molecule obtained from the lambda term proposed in the <a href="http://www.little-lisper.org/website/files/lambda-calculus-tutorial.pdf">lambda calculus tutorial by Mayer Goldberg from the little-lisper.org</a>, par. 57, page 14. But that molecule computes successfully only in 20% of the cases (recall that I use a random reduction algorithm), as shown in <a href="http://chorasimilarity.github.io/chemlambda-gui/dynamic/lisfact_2.html">this example</a>. It is nevertheless a bit successful, differently from the molecule which corresponds exactly to the lambda term from the little lisper tutorial (not that is something wrong with that term, but in chemlambda it <a href="http://chorasimilarity.github.io/chemlambda-gui/dynamic/lisfact.html">does not work as expected</a>). The question is why it does not work well, when in the case of the <a href="http://chorasimilarity.github.io/chemlambda-gui/dynamic/fo_ackermann_2_2.html">Ackermann function the term proposed in the tutorial works superbly</a>. The answer seems to be the fact that in chemlambda the molecules which are not needed do not disappear, instead, like in nature, they continue to interact with the useful parts. There is no problem with the recurrence based on a function with two inputs and two outputs, even in a random environment where the values are not passed from here to there, instead there is a signal transduction phenomenon which builds graphs here and there. The problem is with the interaction between trashed parts of the molecule and useful ones. In order to prove this I modified the factorial function molecule (which is successful in 20% of the cases) by a relative of it, and <a href="http://chorasimilarity.github.io/chemlambda-gui/dynamic/lisfact_4.html">this time the computation is always successful</a> (or have I been lucky all the times?). In this new example there is no trashing used.</ul>

See below for an older example and explanations. Not for the faint at hearts, because there are thousands of nodes coming and going. That is why the edges are darkened and the nodes are smaller. When you look at it without knowing what will give eventually, i.e. Ack(3,2)=29, you can see only the global, overall structure of a cell or organelle  busy with a mysterious, complex activity. But there is nothing global happening there, all graph rewrites performed by the algorithm (random reduction) are purely local, that is they are completely indifferent about any global structure. There is no director of this elaborate cast. I guess that this is what it makes life like. </ul>

In the random environment the molecule is no longer a quine (does no longer preserve its shape), but instead it becomes bigger or smaller. I hypothesize that quines are good models of living creatures. In the deterministical reduction method such a creature would live forever, because its inner metabolism is perfectly equilibrated (keeps its shape after a reduction step). In the random reduction method the quine has a life.</ul>

It reduces to a number (as seen in chemlambda via the Church encoding). More interestingly, if you examine closer the reduction process (here the random reduction method), then you'l discover inside the molecule a smaller one which I called a "walker". It keeps its shape and "walks" on a trail of nodes. That led to the discovery of chemlambda quines. See the <a href="http://chorasimilarity.wordpress.com/2014/08/27/ouroboros-predecessor-iii-the-walking-machine/">series of posts about that, in my open notebook</a>.   </ul>

We know that chemlambda is Turing universal (proved first time <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.6914">here</a>, so it is nice to see it can compute the Ackermann function. I took as an example Ackermann(2,2) because numbers are represented via their Church encoding, therefore big numbers are really big graphs in any unary representation. it is fascinating to see how the Ackermann(2,2) is computed in chemlambda because it does so many things in parallel. Another interesting try would be Ackermann(3,2), see <a href="http://chorasimilarity.wordpress.com/2014/10/13/the-ackermann-function-in-the-chemlambda-gui/">this post from my open notebook about it</a>. By using the programs I have, the visualization (not the computation) is a bit punishing for the computer, because there are moments when hundreds of nodes and links appear and dissapear, but probably a better programmer could easily tweak the scripts to behave better. The take home message is this: you can compute without any evaluation, without any variable passing and without any overall control. This is in support for the hypothesis that chemlambda computes in the way living organism compute.  </ul>

    margin:35px 0 36px;      > <a href="http://chorasimilarity.github.io/chemlambda-gui/dynamic/yfrcombtreefo.html">YI multiplied.</a>  This is a complex reduction in chemlambda. It is a proof of concept that chemlambda can easily treat in the same time self-multiplication and computation (reductions). In this example we start from the fact that one can write the Y combinator as an expression in the S,K,I, combinators: Y = S (K (S I I)) (S (S (K S) K) (K (S I I))). In a previous experiment, with the older scripts, see <a href="http://youtu.be/AjMWLPBkveI">this video</a>,  I transformed that expression into a molecule and then let it reduce by itself. It worked great. Now, in this example I use the said expression of Y and I apply it to the identity combinator, then I add a FO node on top which will effect the self-reproduction of the big expression. What will happen? So, we have a bunch of reductions (from the long expression to YI) in parallel with the self-reproduction of the whole thing. You shall see that everything works well, and that self-reproduction happens in parallel with reduction, even if all this is done in a model of computation which uses a random reduction strategy.   </ul>
